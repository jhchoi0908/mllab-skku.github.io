"Machine Learning is the domain of Artificial Intelligence that studies how to get software to perform certain cognitive tasks such as classification, prediction and clustering, getting better at it over time without human interaction"

At ML Lab@SKKU, we focus on machine learning theories as well as novel image processing/computer vision techniques. The Lab is directed by Prof. Joon Hee Choi from 2019.
