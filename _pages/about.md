"Machine Learning is the domain of Artificial Intelligence that studies how to get software to perform certain cognitive tasks such as classification, prediction and clustering, getting better at it over time without human interaction"

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Lab. was established under the guidance of Professor Chang D. Yoo in 1999, the year he arrived at KAIST. Using various machine learning theories and novel signal processing techniques, signals such as image, text, speech, audio, video, EEG and financial data are processed for longstanding and emerging applications.

At ML Lab@SKKU, we focus on machine learning theories as well as novel image processing/computer vision techniques. The Lab is directed by Prof. Joon Hee Choi from 2019.
